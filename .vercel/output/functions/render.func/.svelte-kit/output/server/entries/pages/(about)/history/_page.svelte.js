    <p>Pateros Catholic School is a non-stock, non-profit co-educational sectarian school established in Pateros, Metro Manila, then, a part of Rizal Province. It was founded on June 1, 1951 by then Reverend Monsignor Felix G. Sicat. Initially, the name Pateros Catholic High School was adopted because it offered mainly secondary courses with vocational subjects. It all began along with the renovation and repairs of the church in 1951. A small school with four classrooms for two freshmen and two sophomore classes with ninety eight students started its operation. Thereafter it steadily increased by one level every year until the high school level was completed. In accordance with Philippine laws, the school was incorporated with the Securities and Exchange Commission on August 4, 1954 with Registry Number 9011. The school was officially recognized as a learning institution with the issuance of Order No. 180 of Republic Act No. 24 on June 1, 1955.
      The opening of the Grade School Department in 1961 paved the way for the school&#39;s change of name to Pateros Catholic School through the initiative of Mrs. Remedios Licsi Cruz, who was the High School Principal at the time. Pursuant to the provisions of Section 16 of the Corporation Code of the Philippines, Batas Pambansa Bilang 68, the Articles of Incorporation were amended and a new set of By-Laws was adopted on September 4, 1980 and filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on March 21, 1983. The transcript of these amended articles and new By-Laws of Incorporation was issued on April 25, 1983.
      Pateros Catholic School, better known as PCS, has been under the jurisdiction of the Archdiocese of Manila. It remains a member of the Manila Archdiocesan and Parochial Schools Association (MAPSA) and the Catholic Educational Association of the Philippines (CEAP). Presently, the institution operates under the newly created Diocese of Pasig and is consequently an active member of the Pasig Diocesan Schools System (PaDSS).
